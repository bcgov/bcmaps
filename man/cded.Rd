\usage{
cded(
  aoi = NULL,
  mapsheets = NULL,
  .predicate = sf::st_intersects,
  dest_vrt = tempfile(fileext = ".vrt")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{aoi}{Area of Interest. An sf polygon.}

\item{mapsheets}{Mapsheets grid to retrieve raster tiles. Defaults to mapsheets_250K}

\item{.predicate}{geometry predicate function used to find the mapsheets from your aoi. Default \link[sf:geos_binary_pred]{sf::st_intersects}.}

\item{dest_vrt}{The location of the vrt file. Defaults to a temporary file, but can be overridden if you'd like to save it for a project}
}
\value{
path to a .vrt file of the cded tiles for the specified area of interest
}
\description{
Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for British Columbia produced by GeoBC. This data is the
TRIM DEM converted to the Canadian Digital Elevation Data (CDED) format. The data consists
of an ordered array of ground or reflective surface elevations, recorded in metres, at regularly
spaced intervals. The spacing of the grid points is .75 arc seconds north/south. The data was
converted into 1:50,000 grids for distribution. The scale of this modified data is
1:250,000 which was captured from the original source data which was at a scale of 1:20,000.
