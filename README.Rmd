## Overview

An [R](https://www.r-project.org) package of spatial map layers for British Columbia.

## Features

Provides access to various spatial layers of British Columbia, such as 
administrative boundaries, natural resource management boundaries, watercourses etc. 
All layers are available in the
[BC Albers](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/nad83-bc-albers/) projection, which is the B.C. Government standard as `sf` or `Spatial` objects. 

Most layers are assessed directly from the [B.C. Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/) using the [bcdata](https://github.com/bcgov/bcdata) R package. See each layers individual help file for more detail.


> _**IMPORTANT NOTE** All support for Spatial objects (`sp`) is deprecated in {bcmaps} v1.2.0. Please use `sf` objects with {bcmaps}._


## Installation

You can install `bcmaps` from CRAN:
```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("bcmaps")
```

To install the development version of the `bcmaps` package, you need to install the `remotes` package then the `bcmaps` package.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("bcgov/bcmaps")
```

## Usage

To see the layers that are available, run the `available_layers()` function:
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(bcmaps)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(bcmaps)
available_layers()
```

Most layers are accessible by a shortcut function by the same name as the object. 
Then you can use the data as you would any `sf` or `Spatial` object. The first time
you run try to access a layer, you will be prompted for permission to download that layer
to your hard drive. Subsequently that layer is available locally for easy future access. For example:

```{r}
library(sf)

bc <- bc_bound()
plot(st_geometry(bc))
```

### Simple Features objects
By default, all layers are returned as [`sf` spatial objects](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf):

```{r plot-maps, fig.height=5, warning=FALSE}
library(bcmaps)
library(sf)

# Load and plot the boundaries of B.C.

bc <- bc_bound()
plot(st_geometry(bc))

## Next load the Regional Districts data, then extract and plot the Kootenays
rd <- regional_districts()
kootenays <- rd[rd$ADMIN_AREA_NAME == "Regional District of Central Kootenay", ]
plot(st_geometry(kootenays), col = "lightseagreen", add = TRUE)
```

### Digital Elevation Model for British Columbia 1:250,000 

The `cded_raster` and `cded_stars` functions return the 1:250,000 digital elevation model for British Columbia bounded by some area of interest. Here we are retrieving the area bounded by the _Logan Lake_ census subdivision:

```{r cded}
library(raster)

aoi <- census_subdivision()[census_subdivision()$CENSUS_SUBDIVISION_NAME == "Logan Lake", ]
aoi_raster <- cded_raster(aoi)
plot(aoi_raster)
```

### It's a beautiful day in the neighbourhood

A handy layer for creating maps for display is the `bc_neighbours` layer, accessible with the function by the same name. This example also illustrates using the popular [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package to plot maps in R using `geom_sf`:

```{r bc_neighbours}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() + 
  geom_sf(data = bc_neighbours(), mapping = aes(fill = name)) + 
  geom_sf(data = bc_cities()) +
  coord_sf(datum = NA) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = "Jurisdiction") +
  theme_minimal()
```


### Biogeoclimatic Zones

As of version 0.15.0 the B.C. BEC (Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification) map
is available via the `bec()` function, and an accompanying function `bec_colours()` 
function to colour it:

```{r include=FALSE}
bec <- bec(ask = FALSE)
```

```{r bec, message=FALSE}
bec <- bec()
library(ggplot2)
bec_sub <- bec[bec$ZONE %in% c("BG", "PP"),]
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = bec_sub,
          aes(fill = ZONE, col = ZONE)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = bec_colors()) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = bec_colours())

```

### Spatial (sp) objects

> _**IMPORTANT NOTE** All support for Spatial objects (`sp`) is deprecated in {bcmaps} v1.2.0. Please use `sf` objects with {bcmaps}._

If you aren't using the `sf` package and prefer the old standard [`sp`](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sp)
way of doing things, set `class = "sp"` in either `get_layer` or the shortcut functions:

```{r watercourses, warning=FALSE}
library("sp")
# Load watercourse data and plot with boundaries of B.C.
plot(bc_bound(class = "sp"))
plot(watercourses_15M(class = "sp"), add = TRUE)
```

### Updating layers

When you first call a layer function bcmaps will remind you when that layer was last updated in your cache with a message. For a number of reasons, it might be necessary to get a fresh layer in your bcmaps cache. The easiest way to update is to use the `force` argument:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
ep <- ecoprovinces(force = TRUE)
```

Another option is to actively manage your cache by deleting the old layer and calling the function again:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
delete_cache('ecoprovinces')
ep <- ecoprovinces(force = TRUE)
```


### Vignettes

After installing the package you can view vignettes by typing `browseVignettes("bcmaps")` in your R session.

### Utility Functions

The package also contains a couple of handy utility functions:

1. `fix_geo_problems()` for fixing invalid topologies in `sf` or `Spatial` objects 
such as orphaned holes and self-intersections (`class = "sp"` _deprecated_ in v1.2.0)
2. `transform_bc_albers()` for transforming any `sf` or `Spatial` object to 
[BC Albers](https://epsg.io/3005) projection. (`class = "sp"` _deprecated_ in v1.2.0)
3. `self_union()` Union a `SpatialPolygons*` object with itself to remove overlaps, while retaining attributes (_deprecated in v1.2.0_)
