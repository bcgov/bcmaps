An [R](https://www.r-project.org) package of spatial map layers for
British Columbia.

`bcmaps` provides access to various spatial layers of British Columbia,
such as administrative boundaries, natural resource management
boundaries, watercourses, census boundaries, etc. All layers are
available as `sf` objects in the [BC
Albers](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/nad83-bc-albers/)
projection, which is the B.C. Government standard.

Most layers are accessed directly from the [B.C. Data
Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/) using the
[bcdata](https://github.com/bcgov/bcdata) R package under the hood. See
each layerâ€™s individual help file for more detail.

> ***IMPORTANT NOTE** Support for Spatial objects (`sp`) was removed in
> {bcmaps} v1.3.0. Please use `sf` objects with {bcmaps}.* A discussion
> on the evolution of the spatial software stack in R can be found here:
> <https://r-spatial.org/r/2022/04/12/evolution.html>.

## Installation

You can install `bcmaps` from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("bcmaps")
```

To install the development version of the `bcmaps` package, you need to
install the `remotes` package then the `bcmaps` package.

``` r
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("bcgov/bcmaps")
```

## Quick Start

To see the layers that are available, run the `available_layers()`
function:

``` r
library(bcmaps)
available_layers()
```

Most layers are accessible by a shortcut function by the same name as
the object. Then you can use the data as you would any `sf` object.

``` r
library(sf)

bc <- bc_bound()
plot(st_geometry(bc))
```
