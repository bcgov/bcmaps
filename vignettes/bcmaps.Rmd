## Overview

`bcmaps` is an [R](https://www.r-project.org) package of spatial map layers for British Columbia.


`bcmaps` provides access to various spatial layers of British Columbia, such as
administrative boundaries, natural resource management boundaries, watercourses, census boundaries, etc. All layers are available as `sf` objects in the
[BC Albers](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/nad83-bc-albers/) projection, which is the B.C. Government standard.

Most layers are accessed directly from the [B.C. Data Catalogue](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/) using the [bcdata](https://github.com/bcgov/bcdata) R package under the hood. See each layer's individual help file for more detail.

> _**IMPORTANT NOTE** Support for Spatial objects (`sp`) was removed in {bcmaps} v1.3.0. Please use `sf` objects with {bcmaps}._ A discussion on the evolution of the spatial software stack in R can be found here: https://r-spatial.org/r/2022/04/12/evolution.html.


## Usage

To see the layers that are available, run the `available_layers()` function:




```r
library(bcmaps)
available_layers()
```

Most layers are accessible by a shortcut function by the same name as the object.
Then you can use the data as you would any `sf` object. The first time
you try to access a layer, you will be prompted for permission to download that layer
to your hard drive. Subsequently that layer is available locally for easy future access. For example:


```r
library(sf)

bc <- bc_bound()
plot(st_geometry(bc))
```

There are two British Columbia boundary map layers available in `bcmaps`:

- `bc_bound()` for fast plotting with suitable detail for most figures (source: [(7.5M) Provinces and States - The Atlas of Canada Base Maps for BC](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/b9bd93e1-0226-4351-b943-05c6f80bd5da))
- `bc_bound_hres()` for geospatial analyses requiring detailed lineworks of British Columbia (source: [Province of British Columbia - Boundary Terrestrial](https://catalogue.data.gov.bc.ca/dataset/30aeb5c1-4285-46c8-b60b-15b1a6f4258b))

### Simple Features objects

By default, all layers are returned as [`sf` spatial objects](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sf):


```r
library(bcmaps)
library(sf)

# Load and plot the boundaries of B.C.

bc <- bc_bound()
plot(st_geometry(bc))

## Next load the Regional Districts data, then extract and plot the Kootenays
rd <- regional_districts()
kootenays <- rd[rd$ADMIN_AREA_NAME == "Regional District of Central Kootenay", ]
plot(st_geometry(kootenays), col = "lightseagreen", add = TRUE)
```

### Digital Elevation Model for British Columbia 1:250,000

The `cded_raster` and `cded_stars` functions return the 1:250,000 digital elevation model for British Columbia bounded by some area of interest. Here we are retrieving the area bounded by the _Logan Lake_ census subdivision:


```r
library(raster)

aoi <- census_subdivision()[census_subdivision()$CENSUS_SUBDIVISION_NAME == "Logan Lake", ]
aoi_raster <- cded_raster(aoi)
plot(aoi_raster)
```

### It's a beautiful day in the neighbourhood

A handy layer for creating maps for display is the `bc_neighbours` layer, accessible with the function by the same name. This example also illustrates using the popular [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package to plot maps in R using `geom_sf` and the `bc_cities()` function available in `bcmaps`:


```r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = bc_neighbours(), mapping = aes(fill = name)) +
  geom_sf(data = bc_cities()) +
  coord_sf(datum = NA) +
  scale_fill_viridis_d(name = "Jurisdiction") +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Biogeoclimatic Zones

As of version 0.15.0 the B.C. BEC (Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification) map
is available via the `bec()` function, and an accompanying function `bec_colours()`
function to colour it:




```r
bec <- bec()
library(ggplot2)
bec_sub <- bec[bec$ZONE %in% c("BG", "PP"),]
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = bec_sub,
          aes(fill = ZONE, col = ZONE)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = bec_colors()) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = bec_colours())
```

### Updating layers

When you first call a layer function `bcmaps` will remind you when that layer was last updated in your cache with a message. For a number of reasons, it might be necessary to get a fresh layer in your `bcmaps` cache. The easiest way to update is to use the `force` argument:


```r
ep <- ecoprovinces(force = TRUE)
```

Another option is to actively manage your cache by deleting the old layer and calling the function again:


```r
show_cached_files()
delete_cache('ecoprovinces')
ep <- ecoprovinces()
```

### Utility Functions

The package also contains a few handy utility functions:

- `transform_bc_albers()` for transforming any `sf` object to
[BC Albers](https://epsg.io/3005) projection
- `bc_area()` to get the total area of British Columbia in various units
- `bc_bbox()` to get an extend/bounding box for British Columbia
